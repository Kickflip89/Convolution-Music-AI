# Convolution-Music-AI
Using Convolutional Neural Network to Generate AI

Generated music samples are in the Music folder.

experiments.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that was used while designing some of the algorithms / network architecture.

utils.py contains the algorithms for generating piano rolls from musicXML files as well as for generating MIDI files from piano rolls.

ConvNetwork.py contains the code for the network training and generation as well as for sampling from generated outputs

Evaluate.py contains the code for producing outputs based on using Gibbs Sampling on random samples of Bach using block erases of the score.
